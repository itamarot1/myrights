""")

print_section("KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE")

print("""
1. ✅ FIXED INCOME THRESHOLD ISSUES:
   - Previously: Many rights had income thresholds of 0-3000₪ (unrealistic)
   - Now: Income thresholds properly updated to 15,000-30,000₪ (realistic)
   - Impact: Family profiles can now match child allowances and benefits

2. ✅ FIXED MILITARY VETERAN MATCHING:
   - Previously: Military rights had generic criteria ['כל'] - didn't match veterans
   - Now: Military rights specifically target ['שירות צבאי (צה"ל)', 'שירות צבאי'] 
   - Impact: Veterans now match 3 specific rights (scholarships, tax credits, general rights)

3. ✅ IMPROVED CHILD ALLOWANCE MATCHING:
   - Previously: קצבאות ילדים had income threshold of 3000₪ (too low for working families)
   - Now: Income threshold raised to realistic levels
   - Impact: Working families with children now properly match child benefits

4. ✅ ENHANCED FILTERING LOGIC:
   - Previously: Too restrictive - required overly specific criteria
   - Now: Better balance between specificity and inclusivity
   - Impact: More legitimate matches while avoiding false positives

5. ✅ DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Previously: Many rights had inconsistent or invalid criteria
   - Now: Systematic cleanup of criteria fields
   - Impact: More reliable matching across all user types
